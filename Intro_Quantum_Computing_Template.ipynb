        "Welcome to the Vagelos Computational Science Center's Intro to Quantum Computing workshop! Today we'll be using Qiskit, IBM's quantum simulation software development kit. Qiskit is compatible with Python, so we'll also cover a few basics of Python along the way. Qiskit has pretty extensive documentation, helpful tutorials, and a textbook. We'll introduce a some basics concepts here, and if you're interested in learning more after this workshop I highly recommend you check out some of their materials [here](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/introduction.html).\n",
