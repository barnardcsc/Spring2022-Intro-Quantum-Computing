# Introduction to Quantum Computing, Spring 2022
*An introductory lecture and workshop on quantum computing, using IBM's Python-based Qiskit. Developed for the Vagelos Computational Science Center (CSC) by ZoÃ« Webb-Mack (CSC Postbacc Fellow, AY 2021-2022). More information about the event can be found [here](https://csc.barnard.edu/events/workshop-intro-quantum-computing).*

## Workshop description: 
This is an introductory workshop on quantum computing.  The first half of the workshop is a presentation which covers quantum computing broadly and introduces notation + technical concepts relevant to the coding portion of the workshop.  The second half of the workshop is a live coding workshop using IBM's Python-based Qiskit software development kit to create and run quantum circuits in Google Colab/Jupyter notebooks.

## Workshop goals:
The workshop aims to give attendees enough of a background (broad context and basic hands-on experience) that they have a general picture of how quantum computing works and are empowered to continue learning using the robust resources available online.

### Attendees will walk away with:
- General literacy around quantum computing (such that they can interpret news about quantum computing):
- A working definition of a quantum computer; a working understanding of how quantum computers are constructed.
- A basic understanding of the advantages of quantum computing and the limitations of the state of quantum computing.
- Foundational technical literacy (such that they are empowered to continue working with Qiskit or otherwise playing around with quantum circuits):
- Foundational understanding of the uniquely quantum features of quantum computing (superposition and entanglement).
- Exposure to quantum circuits and experience writing quantum circuits.
- Experience working with Qiskit and running circuits using a simulator and a real IBM quantum computer.
- Experience interpreting measurement outputs of quantum circuits.

## In this repository, you will find the following materials:
- *Intro Quantum Computing Slides* (slidedeck): The slidedeck used for the presentation portion of the workshop (a simplified intro to quantum computing).
- *Intro Quantum Computing Template.ipynb* (student template): A workbook for students.  At the beginning of the workshop, students should make a copy so that they can work directly on their version of this file during the workshop.  Contains some text to guide the flow of the workshop and comments to structure code cells, but contains minimal pre-written code.
- *Intro Quantum Computing Key.ipynb* (key): Identical to the student template, but code cells are complete.  Serves as a key to reference (as a print-out or on another screen) while working through the workshop.
